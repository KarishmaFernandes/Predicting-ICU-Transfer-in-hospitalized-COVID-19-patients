If a  patient exhibiting symptoms associated with COVID-19 enters a hospital and given the  age, gender , past  history of comorbidities  and other vital signs  for that patient , then  I can predict using a trained   supervised machine learning algorithm if that  patient  will need an Intensive care unit (ICU ) transfer.
This is a binary classification challenge. My  goal will be  to predict the patient was admitted to the ICU is 0 or 1.
If ‘ 1’, patient was admitted to ICU.
If  ‘0’ patient was not admitted to ICU.
